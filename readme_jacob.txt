1. old file without limit can scrape tweets with keywords, but does not stop;  
2. main_part_tweepy has a limit command, but that doesn't work, maybe it's because of the <a> command? I'm still trying to fix it. If it works, it should be able to scrape
a few tweets with keywords, and then export them as a json file.  
3. the next step might be to get only the text, date, location or other information from the raw tweets.
