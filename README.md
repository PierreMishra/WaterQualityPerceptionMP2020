## Objective

Using Data Mining to Assess Public Perception of Water Quality 

## Description

Water quality issues such as eutrophication, reduced clarity, and harmful algal blooms negatively impact designated uses of water bodies, including recreation. Government agencies often need to assess how public recreation may be impacted by water quality issues, which historically involved time consuming and costly surveys. The ubiquitous use of social media and the development of data mining and analysis tools presents an opportunity to discover detailed information about how the public interacts with water bodies. We are interested in developing data mining tools that can be deployed with our government agency clients to better inform nutrient criteria development and public communication. 

The ultimate goal of this research to quantify the extent to which social media information tracks or predicts water quality conditions. Potential uses include earlier warning/detection systems for events like spills, HABs, sediment pollution, etc.  

## Steps

1. Determine potential data sources relating to public perception of water quality  
2. Acquire public perception data on water quality using web scraping tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Twitter API)  
3. Analyze public perception data for the states of North Carolina and Utah using techniques such as sentiment analysis, spatial analysis, and time-series analysis  
4. Characterize the types of data, pros, and cons of different search engines and social media platforms for public perception analysis  
5. Compare public perception data (e.g., visitation, sentiments) to quantitative water quality data from state agencies and the Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s CyAN app.
